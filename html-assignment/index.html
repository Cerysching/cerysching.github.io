        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm passionate about design and want to create beautiful and functional websites. But web dev is really difficult to me. I feel confuse to learned HTML and CSS. But i am still trying hard to learn it. I wish i can make it done. Outside of design, I enjoy hiking in nature, playing with my dog and gardening, and trying out new recipes in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>I recently moved to Ottawa from Hong Kong. It is a whole new place to me. I never been to Canada before. English is not my mother language and i quitted school for more than 10 years. So changing everything is uncomfortable to me which is also a big challenge. I wish i can get used to everything soon. </p>
